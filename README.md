# Resource-Pack-Setter
Sets the server.properties file of a Minecraft server depending on the current day.

### Usage:
1.) Replace the 'link' property in resources.properties as a dropbox link to your resource pack (make sure to change the 0 at the end to a 1).
2.) Place the script and resources.properties file in the Minecraft server directory (where the server jar and server.properties files are).
3.) Run the python file using 'python resourcepack.py' before running the server each time the server is run. Optimally, the statement can just be added to a bat file that starts the server.
